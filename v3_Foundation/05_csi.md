## CSI Interface with SLM
Both SLM and CSI have monitoring and reporting as a primary activity. In fact, CSI assists SLM in the compilation and creation of customer reports. However, the Service Level Manager is the only role who physically presents these reports to the customer, as SLM is the sole customer interface. Although both CSI and SLM are concerned with improving service quality, there is one key difference—CSI is constantly occurring, even when metrics show that IT is performing well. But improvement initiatives championed by SLM (called Service Improvement Plans, or SIPs) are only implemented when services are not meeting our targets in the Service Level Agreements. SIPs are temporary; CSI is always happening.
