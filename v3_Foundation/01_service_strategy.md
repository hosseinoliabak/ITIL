# Service Strategy
## Service Portfolio Management (SPM):
Service Portfolio Management is an ongoing process which considers Services in terms of the Business value that they provide.
* The main purpose of a Service Portfolio is to describe services in terms of business value
  * Represents all resources currently engaged or being released throughout the service lifecycle
  * Links services to business needs and describes value
  * Clarifies strategic questions
    * Why should a customer buy this service? What are the attractive options? Value?
    * Why should they buy it from us? What differentiates us from other potential providers
    * How do we charge? Services cost money
    * What are strengths and weaknesses?
    * What are priorities and risks?
    * How should our resources (tangible assets: information, people, infrastructure, applications…) and capabilities (intangible assets: management, organization, processes, knowledge…) be allocated?

The Service Portfolio represents a complete list of the services managed by a service provider; some of these services are visible to the customers, while others are not. The Service Portfolio is divided into three phases: Service Pipeline, Service Catalogue, and Retired Services.
* Service Pipeline: those lists of services that currently are under consideration, they are in development, but they are not yet available. Why is that part of the portfolio? Because we are putting time, resources, money, and effort against this.
* Service Catalog: it is a database that outlines and identifies the details of live services. This is visible to Customer (Business Service Catalogue) and visible to Support team (Technical Service Catalogue)
* Retired Services: Services that are no longer used.

### Service Portfolio Process (Stages for definition of strategy are):
1.	Define: Service Level Requirement is being produced
2.	Analyze: the new service requirements are being analyzed and prioritized
3.	Approval: the new service requirements have been finalized and authorized
4.	Charter: the new service requirements are being communicated to the relevant stakeholders and resources and budgets allocated

## Financial Management for IT Services:
To ensure the appropriate level of funding to design, develop and deliver services that meet the strategy of the organization.
* Gatekeeper of founds:
  * Differentiate between costs and quality
  * Balance supply and demand
* Sub-processes: Financial management for IT services contains 3 sub-processes:
  * **Budgeting:** enables an organization to plan future IT expenditures, reducing the risk of over-spending and ensuring the revenues are available to cover the predicted spend
  * **IT Accounting:** is concerned with the amount of money spent in providing IT services
  * **Charging:** provides the ability to assign costs of an IT Service proportionally and fairly to the users of that service
* Financial Cycles – planning (annual) and operational (monthly)
* Business case input
  * Business Case: Justification for a significant item of expenditure. Includes information about Costs, benefits, options, issues, Risks, and possible problems
  * Decision support and planning tools
  * Should focus on the tangible, quantitative, or qualitative aspects
* Financial Management is an important input to Service Portfolio Management or SPM

## Demand Management:
To understand user demand for IT services, possibly influence their demand, and provide solid planning data to the Service Design process of Capacity Management
* Patterns of Business Activity (PBA):
  * They may be certain times of the day/month/year the business behave in a way that impacts IT
  * How, when, where, by who is a service used
  * Used to code usage and manage demand for the service delivered by service provider
* User Profile (UP):
  * Certain users may use services differently than other users

Demand management goes hand-in-hand with Capacity Management. Demand Management Identifies PBA here in-Service Strategy phase so Capacity Management can then design a solution to meet the demand

## Business Relationship Management (BRM):
Ensures the service provider understands the business requirements and is able to deliver.
* Creates/maintains a business relationship between customer and service provider
* Identifies business needs; ensures business can meet them
* SLM & BRM
  * SLM is much more operationally oriented; works to achieve agreed levels of service
  * BRM is strategic in nature (utility & warranty); customer satisfaction; works with portfolio, SLM, SACM, Capacity Management, Demand Management...
